1> First open eclipse. Start a new java project.

2> Add external jars from the following:
	/usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.8.0.jar
	/usr/local/hadoop/share/hadoop/common/hadoop-common-2.8.0.jar

3> Create new class and write program. Make sure that it is not in any package. and all inner classes 	  are static.

4> Export the project as a jar and save it on desktop.

5> Open terminal.

6> su hduser
   password: hadoop

7> start-dfs.sh
   start-yarn.sh
   check if all 6 services have started using jps

8> hadoop fs -mkdir <dir_name> : to create a directory on HDFS

9> Create a folder on desktop with name inputfile
   create an input file inside that folder.

10> hadoop fs -put 'path to folder on the desktop that contains the input file' /
    this copies the entire folder on the desktop in HDFS root

11> cd /usr/local/hadoop
    change directory to hadoop

12> bin/hadoop jar <path to jar file> <class_name> /inputfile/input /myOutput
    /home/gaurav/Desktop/WordCount.jar
    WordCount <=: main class
    /myOutput <= directory in hdfs where output will be stored

13> you can check the directories being crated and stuff by going to
    http://localhost:50070 <= HDFS browser
    then to to utilities and browse file system
    
    Yarn resource manager at http://localhost:8088
